## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- javascript

### What I learned

I strugglled a lot with the scss part because of the diversity of inputs and special cases. I think that my structure is far from optimal and maintenance should be hard!
Any advice on that point are welcome. I really liked the javascript part and I learned how to deal with inputs value as it was my first time.
On the inputs, I didn't manage to get the outline correctly on safari. Does anyone know the tricks?
